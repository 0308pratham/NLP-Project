# NLP-Project
The NLP Weather Detection Project is a machine learning endeavor that aims to predict weather conditions (specifically, "sunny" or "rainy") based on textual descriptions of historical weather data. By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project demonstrates how text data can be leveraged for accurate weather prediction.
