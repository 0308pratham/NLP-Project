# NLP-Project
The NLP Weather Detection Project is a machine learning endeavor that aims to predict weather conditions (specifically, "sunny" or "rainy") based on textual descriptions of historical weather data. By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project demonstrates how text data can be leveraged for accurate weather prediction.
Key Features:

Data Processing: Processed historical weather data, extracting descriptive text and corresponding weather labels.
Text Vectorization: Employed NLP techniques like CountVectorizer to convert textual descriptions into numerical vectors.
Model Training: Utilized a Naive Bayes classifier to train the model on the vectorized text data and weather labels.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Interpretation: Analyzed model results, identified strengths and weaknesses, and considered avenues for improvement.
Optional Deployment: Demonstrated the potential for deploying the model to make real-time predictions.
How to Use:

Dataset: The dataset includes historical weather data with descriptions and weather labels (sunny/rainy).
Preprocessing: The Python code demonstrates data preprocessing steps, including text vectorization.
Model Training: The project showcases model training using a Naive Bayes classifier.
Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed for model evaluation.
Enhancement: Users can explore improvements, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced NLP techniques.
Optional Deployment: Consider deploying the model to make predictions on new weather descriptions.
Requirements:

Python
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
